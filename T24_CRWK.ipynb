It consists of customer product reviews labeled with binary sentiment annotations hence can be used to do supervised text classification exercises. To each review is attached the label with its sentiments, __label__1 will say negative reviews and __label__2 is a label that will say positive reviews.\n",
        "The information is presented in the FastText format, where, each record is a combination of a label and the textual representation of the review. An example would be a line that shows __label__2 This product surpassed my expectations in all respects and that is a review of sentiments. This data set is split into two subsets namely; training set which consists of 3600000 reviews and test set which consists of 400000 reviews. This division provides enough data to use in training the model and leaving a large part to be used in assessment without bias.\n",
        "Review samples indicate high diversity in the length of texts, writing styles, and product categories, which creates real practical problems of sentiment analysis. Such heterogeneity renders the dataset to be a useful set of benchmarking on the suitability of machine learning pipelines and the robustness of textual classification models on any sort of textual data.\n",

        "PySpark is used to do data cleaning and extraction using the distributed processing power. Raw text files are read linewise and numeric labels/review discussions are marked with the help of regular expressions. This makes sure that the label and review text are put in two different columns in a Spark DataFrame. Elements of reviews with null or empty values of the text are withdrawn as a way to guarantee quality of data and hence error in training of the model. The missing DataFrame entries are checked by validation of the training and test DataFrames to ensure the constancy of the obtained data. These measures will guarantee that preprocessing and modelling phases currently are performed on a credible and clean dataset, which minimizes the potential possibility of both biased or unvalid outcomes.\n",

The PySpark Tokenizer will be utilised on tokenisation, breaking reviews into separate words. The Stop words are then eliminated using StopWordsRemover to remove the common English words, which have Apache, (2025), less contribution towards discrimination of sentiment (Apache, 2025e). CountVectorizer is used to perform feature extraction on the tokenised text and describes Apache, (2025a) word frequencies as numerical vectors. This generates a sparse matrix of high dimensions Apache, (2025b), that work with both Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers. This allows an increase in computational efficiency, by caching the resulting training and test DataFrames in memory, thus making quicker available in model training and evaluation."

        "\n",
        "For this project, two machine learning models were selected:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model that is well-suited for high-dimensional data. It was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in multi-class classification tasks.\n",
        "2. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model that is particularly effective for text classification. It assumes independence between features, making it computationally efficient.\n",

        "### Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "The models were implemented using PySpark's MLlib, which provides a robust framework for distributed machine learning. The following steps were followed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pipeline Creation**: A pipeline was created to streamline the preprocessing and modeling steps. This included tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF transformation, and model training.\n",
        "2. **Training and Testing**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. This ensured that the models were evaluated on unseen data.\n",
        "3. **Model Training**: Both models were trained on the preprocessed data. Logistic Regression was configured with a maximum of 10 iterations, while Naive Bayes used default parameters.\n",

        "Logistic Regression is a linear probabilistic classifier which makes predictions concerning the likelihood that the categorical outcome is binary. CountVectorizer encodes the tokenised texts as numerical feature vectors and labels reflect a negative (1) or positive (2) sentiment. This model would be trained on training set, and tested on test set. The metrics of the evaluation comprise accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Logistic Regression is well-applied to large dimensional sparse data and demonstrates a linear decision boundary which is adequate in sentiment separation (Machinelearningplus, 2025).\n",
        "Naive Bayes, known as a probabilistic classifier, that assumes feature independence. It makes use of the same CountVectorizer vectors but they should be non-negative. The implementation in the multinomial takes into account a smoothing parameter to avoid the probabilities of zero. Naive Bayes is however limited by high-dimensional sparse data that causes bias to predict toward one of the classes (Koushiki, 2024).\n",

        "Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation is based on the precision, recall, and accuracy along with F1-score. Weighted measures take into consideration class imbalance. Confusion matrices help to get the detailed information about the errors during the classification indicating the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This enables one to have a straightforward comparison between Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, both in terms of advantages and weaknesses as relates to sentiment analysis (Ayan, 2024).\n",

        "1. **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.\n",

The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were determined in PySpark by using MulticlassClassificationEvaluator. Confusion matrices were also created so as to bring about an in-depth analysis of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives of the models. This action allowed the team to measure the model performance and compare two ways in a regular manner.\n",

        "We performs parameter tuning and final model training for a Logistic Regression text classification pipeline in PySpark while being mindful of memory and computation limits. To reduce resource usage, it first takes a 10% random sample of the training data and builds a lightweight pipeline consisting of tokenization, stopword removal, CountVectorizer, TF-IDF transformation, and Logistic Regression. A very small parameter grid is defined, varying only regParam, elasticNetParam, and minDF, and a CrossValidator with 2 folds is run on the sampled data to identify the best parameter combination. Once the best parameters are found, the code retrains a final pipeline on the full dataset using those optimal values. After training, predictions are made on the test set, and the model’s accuracy is reported along with the chosen hyperparameters. To avoid memory leaks, DataFrames are persisted temporarily during training and then safely unpersisted in the cleanup phase. This approach balances performance and efficiency by tuning on a smaller dataset but deploying the best-found configuration on the entire dataset."

        "In comparing the two models, the Logistic Regression obviously excels well over the Naive Bayes under all the evaluation indices. This capability to use the TF-IDF or frequency statistics-based features and operate high-dimensional sparse vectors enables it to form more patterned representations of the sentiment side. Studies that contrast Naive Bayes independence assumptions and sensitivity to feature representation find very low as accuracy of predictions. In the same sentiment analysis task, Logistic Regression is advised especially in CountVectorizer or TF-IDF features since it offers answer results on a probabilistic manner and balanced classification besides scale-ability in distributed environment such as PySpark. Naive Bayes can still be used as a benchmark with smaller and less sparse data.\n",

        "\n",
        "This study successfully implemented a multi-class classification system for analyzing Amazon product reviews using PySpark, a distributed computing framework. The project involved comprehensive preprocessing of textual data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF transformation, to convert raw text into meaningful features. Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, were evaluated for their performance on the dataset. Logistic Regression emerged as the superior model, achieving an accuracy of 89.30%, compared to Naive Bayes, which achieved an accuracy of 8 %. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, provided a detailed understanding of the models' strengths and limitations. Challenges such as class imbalance and computational overhead were effectively addressed through oversampling techniques and optimized parameter tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings of this study underscore the efficacy of PySpark in handling large-scale datasets and building robust machine learning pipelines. Logistic Regression demonstrated its suitability for high-dimensional text data, outperforming Naive Bayes in terms of accuracy and reliability. The project also highlighted the importance of addressing class imbalance and optimizing computational resources to ensure scalability and robustness. Future work could explore advanced techniques such as deep learning models and real-time sentiment analysis to further enhance the system's capabilities. Additionally, incorporating domain-specific features and ensemble methods could provide deeper insights and improve classification performance. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on machine learning applications in big data analytics, offering valuable methodologies and insights for future endeavors."
